Today I continued to work on grinding out the Binary Search Tree class.
Yesterday I began replicating a BST, but did not get to the delete()
method. I also had issues with the insert() and find() methods. 

Today I worked through the bugs in insert() and find(). I also got 
through a large percentage of the delete() method, which is the most
intensive method. Tomorrow I will resolve the delete() method and 
upload a comprehensive testing program as well.
