Today I have been continuing work on Binary Search Tree.
Today I have nearly completed the final method of the BST, the delete() method.
The one issue I have not resolved is how to delete a node that is the root, and has
two children. 

A more comprehensive testing program has been developed further (TreeApp2 class)
