It is now September 12, 2022.

I have gone through the process of building my own Binary Tree.
At times I used Mitchell Waite's 'Data Structures & Algorithms in
Java' textbook for guidance. The hardest method, delete(), was written
entirely organically.

Some of my methods now fully resemble Waite's. Look back at September10,
to see that I produced my own versions that work perfectly. Knowing
that parts of my code were ineffecient, I went back through Waite's ideal
binary tree to pick up on his techniques. As a result, some of my methods
from today, Sept12, are identical to the ones in his book.
